# RotationHUD - work in progress

This is a very niche addon for WoW... It's like a set of weak auras, setup to look like your keypad/section of shortcuts on your keyboard, with a full rotation/button glow addition.

I use a Logitech G13 keypad and I wanted a display onscreen that looks like my layout with button glows. The idea is that it gives great visual feedback for where my finger needs to move to click the correct button. 

I setup my action bars with a rotation addon at first.. then I wanted to see if I could reduce its size and attach it to the target's nameplate. I could do this with Weak Auras, but I didn't like the way to setup the rotation process (not only showing glows, but hiding them etc). Action bars can't be dynamically moved around because of WoW restrictions. And then there's the major factor of wanting to see how to make an addon and see if I could do it. 


For experimental version 1 it's just using Monk Windwalker abilities and the Logitech G13 layout. Once I get it going, I'll add on various classes, keyboard layouts. 

I'm creating it using this G13 layout in mind.. note I'm only concerend with this subsection

So for that set of keys, the on-screen layout looks like this:

-Red glows = cooldowns
-Blue glows = defensives
-Yellow glows = normal damage

I've also attached my ElvUI player health bar to the bottom

The options to change the abilities or alter their priority (there's an option to add a new ability at the bottom of each list):

If there are conditions in addition to basic priority:

For now, I have basic power, energy, health but will add things such as talents, procs, charges next

For the G13 keyboard layout, this is where you can click on any of the icons and change it to whatever you want
