# RotationHUD

This is a very niche addon... it takes the idea of a rotation helper, that puts glows on buttons to press on a layout that mimics your keyboard/gamepad layout. 
It then attaches that layout to the bottom of your target's nameplate. The goal is to have a display that maximizes hand to ability coordination. In other words, 
the layout mimics your keybinds, so when an ability glows, its location in the layout will be where your finger needs to move. I'll add pics later to make this
easier to understand.
